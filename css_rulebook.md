# CSS Formatting Rulebook for This Project

## Preferred CSS Formatting Style

- Each selector (or selector group) must be on its own line.
- All declarations for a selector must be inside braces on a single line.
- Example for grouped selectors:
  
  .selector1,
  .selector2 { property: value; }

- Example for a single selector:
  
  .selector { property: value; }

- No multi-line property blocks, no extra indentation, no trailing spaces.
- This rule applies to all CSS files in this project.
