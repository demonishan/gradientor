# CSS Rulebook for this Project
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Support both light and dark modes
- Keep component styles scoped and organized
- Do not use color names, use hex values instead (e.g., use #fff instead of white)

## Preferred CSS Formatting Style
- Each selector (or selector group) must be on its own line.
- All declarations for a selector must be inside braces on a single line.
- Example for grouped selectors:
  .selector1,
  .selector2 { property: value; }

- Example for a single selector:
  .selector { property: value; }

- No multi-line property blocks, no extra indentation, no trailing spaces.
- This rule applies to all CSS files in this project.
